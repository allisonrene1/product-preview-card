# product-preview-card

This is a super simple product preview card for perfume. I haven't practiced any CSS since August because I've been
so focused on JavaScript, so I wrote this just to see what I still remember.
And I still haven't learned responsive web design yet, i.e. for mobile users, so I really need to focus on that. I'm sure this CSS code is a dumpster fire. Still have so much to learn. Will be starting a course on advanced CSS & Sass soon.
